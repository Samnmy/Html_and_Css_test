    <h2>What I do in my free time ?</h2>
    <p>Since I was a child I always played basketball, this sport has always been with me and that is why I spend most of my free time playing basketball and watching basketball games, but I also take advantage of my free time to practice other sports such as volleyball, boxing and American football.</p>

    <p>In the rest of my free time when I'm at home, I listen to music all the time or read a lot of manga and watch a lot of anime.</p>

    <h2>What music do I like ?</h2>
    <p>Music is part of my life and usually when I am doing most of my activities I always listen to music since this helps me concentrate.</p>
    <p>I'm not usually a person who only listens to one genre of music. I really like diversity in music because I feel there's a different kind of music for every occasion. The list you'll find here is one of my most frequently used playlists.</p>
